# Website Generator 
## Code Examples

In the directory StaticTemplates you will find static html templates.
The site generator will use the special tags in these files to fill them with titles, content, linking structure, images, etc.

I added a few classes which make this generator possible.

I also added the API classes of my domain registration system as example.
